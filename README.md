# CS-230_OperatingPlatforms
This is the summation of my final project for CS-230 Operating Platforms


# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

In this project we assume the role of a consult and are tasked with evaluating the client and designing a template on how to best satisfy their needs.
The name of the client is The Gaming Room and they are developing a game that will be served on multiple different operating systems.
The Game will be web based and written in Java.



# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I was able to clearly show and explain the differences between the various host Operating Systems and why they should and should not be utilized.
Additionally, with my background in web development I believe I was able to visual how the system would work in production and articulate a valid plan on how the system would operate.



# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

In the past I would normally think of a project in just categories front-end, back-end, hosting, etc.
Having a design template such as this is a new experience for me.
That being said, I think it was very helpful when developing the application.
Having a design document would be nearly required when working in a team to ensure that the proper plan is communicated between different team member.
Not having a design document could potentially result in miscommunication and lead to a much different program as a result.



# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think one thing that would need to be flushed out more before starting this project would be how to get the content to the user.
Specially potentially using a REST API or some other type of Query platform to deliver the content to the users.



# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

One off the big needs for the client is the ability to serve the content to multiple different operating systems.
Because of this I needed to make sure that all tools being used would be compatible in the different user environments.



# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

One focus I had one on security in the application.
With users accessing the content on different operating systems the program is more vulnerable than if it was exclusive to one operating system.
Further into production I would want to determine how the inputs from different systems would affect the program.
